# Project Name: Peddy

## Short Description

Peddy is a web application that connects potential pet adopters with pets in need of homes. The platform allows users to browse various pet categories, view detailed information about individual pets, and facilitates the adoption process.

## Key Features

1. **Pet Category Browsing**: Users can view and select different categories of pets (e.g., cats, dogs, rabbits, birds) to find their ideal companion.
2. **Detailed Pet Information**: Each pet has a dedicated card displaying crucial details like breed, birth year, gender, and price, with fallback messages for unavailable data.
3. **Dynamic Loading Spinner**: A user-friendly loading spinner is displayed during data fetching operations to enhance the user experience.
4. **Responsive Design**: The application is built using Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI, ensuring a responsive and aesthetically pleasing layout across various devices.
5. **Error Handling**: The app gracefully handles errors, displaying user-friendly messages if no pets are available or if data fetching fails.

## ES6 Features Used

- **Arrow Functions**: Used for concise function expressions.
- **Template Literals**: Employed for easier string interpolation and multi-line strings.
- **Destructuring Assignment**: Utilized to extract values from objects and arrays easily.
- **Promises and Async/Await**: Implemented for handling asynchronous operations and improving code readability.
- **Let and Const**: Used for block-scoped variable declarations, ensuring better variable management and reducing scope-related bugs.
